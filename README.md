# R scripts searching for associations between the taxonomy and the hosts of phages

R scripts examining the relation of the host (log)likelihood of phages to their taxonomic classification, by means of cluster analysis.

## Hypothetical experimental setup

In the present setting, the host log-likelihood profiles of the phages of interest were assessed using WIsH (Who Is the Host). The above scripts search for clusters based on the log likelihood profiles. This analysis was done to see if the host log-likelihood profiles of phages are correlated with the taxonomy.

## Quick start

After installing R and RStudio (for version, see 'Software' bellow), clone the repository. <br />
From the master script, all other scripts can be run swiftly and easily. <br />
Keep in mind that some parts of the code may need to be taylored to the needs of your own dataset. 

## Software

The scripts were written using: <br />
R version 3.4.0 <br />
RStudio Version 1.0.143
