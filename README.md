# Explore associations between phage taxonomy and hosts

R scripts examining the relation of the host (log)likelihood profiles of phages to their taxonomic classification, by means of cluster analysis. <br />
These scripts are still being edited.

## Hypothetical experimental setup

In the present setting, the host log-likelihood profiles of the phages of interest were assessed using WIsH (Who Is the Host). The above scripts search for clusters based on the log likelihood profiles. This analysis was done to see if the host log-likelihood profiles of phages are correlated with the taxonomy.

## Quick start
After installing R and RStudio (for version, see 'Software' bellow), clone the repository. <br />

```git clone https://github.com/eregenyi/phage-taxonomy-wrt-host.git```

Keep in mind that some parts of the code may need to be taylored to the needs of your own dataset. 

## Software

The scripts were written using: <br />
R version 3.4.0 <br />
RStudio Version 1.0.143
